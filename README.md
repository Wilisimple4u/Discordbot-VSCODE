# I did a thing in a place in a time and you want to copy/learn from it.

This project uses Python and has been made in Visual Studio CODE.

## The Process


### Discord stuff
In order to run the discordbot you need to have made your own discordbot on discord as well as getting the token needed to connect to it.

#

### Python stuff

By Importing my code into Pycharm or whatever else can run this beautiful mess of a code, you should then be able to both run it through pycharm as well as docker container.
Remember to change the "TOKEN" in the run.bat file to the discord token you are going to be using.

#

### Docker stuff

To make it easier on myself and other people that struggle with the terminal, I have added bashfiles that can run the docker commands for you into python.

#

### To build/create the container in docker:
Copythis into the terminal with the file selected -->  .\build.bat

#

### To Start/run the container after building it in docker:

Copythis into the terminal with the file selected -->  .\run.bat



#
#
## For developer aka me:
### Don't forget to make it public and let people see the deployed page from pages.
